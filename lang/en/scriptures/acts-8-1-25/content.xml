				And Saul was there, giving approval to his death.

					The Church Persecuted and Scattered
				</p>
				On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and all except the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria.
			</verse>
			<verse number="2" number-en="2">
				Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="3" number-en="3">
				But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison.
			</verse>
			<verse number="4" number-en="4">
				<p class="scripture-heading">
					Philip in Samaria
				</p>
				Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went.
			</verse>
			<verse number="5" number-en="5">
				Philip went down to a city in Samaria and proclaimed the Christ there.
			</verse>
			<verse number="6" number-en="6">
				When the crowds heard Philip and saw the miraculous signs he did, they all paid close attention to what he said.
			</verse>
			<verse number="7" number-en="7">
				With shrieks, evil spirits came out of many, and many paralytics and cripples were healed.
			</verse>
			<verse number="8" number-en="8">
				So there was great joy in that city.
			</verse>
			<verse number="9" number-en="9">
				<p class="scripture-heading">
					Simon the Sorcerer
				</p>
				Now for some time a man named Simon had practiced sorcery in the city and amazed all the people of Samaria. He boasted that he was someone great,
			</verse>
			<verse number="10" number-en="10">
				and all the people, both high and low, gave him their attention and exclaimed, "This man is the divine power known as the Great Power."
			</verse>
			<verse number="11" number-en="11">
				They followed him because he had amazed them for a long time with his magic.
			</verse>
			<verse number="12" number-en="12">
				But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
			</verse>
			<verse number="13" number-en="13">
				Simon himself believed and was baptized. And he followed Philip everywhere, astonished by the great signs and miracles he saw.
			</verse>
			<verse number="14" number-en="14">
				When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
			</verse>
			<verse number="15" number-en="15">
				When they arrived, they prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
			</verse>
			<verse number="16" number-en="16">
				because the Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them; they had simply been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
			</verse>
			<verse number="17" number-en="17">
				Then Peter and John placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
			</verse>
			<verse number="18" number-en="18">
				When Simon saw that the Spirit was given at the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money
			</verse>
			<verse number="19" number-en="19">
				and said, "Give me also this ability so that everyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
			</verse>
			<verse number="20" number-en="20">
				Peter answered: "May your money perish with you, because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money!
			</verse>
			<verse number="21" number-en="21">
				You have no part or share in this ministry, because your heart is not right before God.
			</verse>
			<verse number="22" number-en="22">
				Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart.
			</verse>
			<verse number="23" number-en="23">
				For I see that you are full of bitterness and captive to sin."
			</verse>
			<verse number="24" number-en="24">
				Then Simon answered, "Pray to the Lord for me so that nothing you have said may happen to me."
			</verse>
			<verse number="25" number-en="25">
				When they had testified and proclaimed the word of the Lord, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many Samaritan villages.
