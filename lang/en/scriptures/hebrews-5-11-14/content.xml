			<verse number="11" number-en="11">
				We have much to say about this, but it is hard to explain because you are slow to learn.
			</verse>
			<verse number="12" number-en="12">
				In fact, though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you the elementary truths of God's word all over again. You need milk, not solid food!
			</verse>
			<verse number="13" number-en="13">
				Anyone who lives on milk, being still an infant, is not acquainted with the teaching about righteousness.
			</verse>
			<verse number="14" number-en="14">
				But solid food is for the mature, who by constant use have trained themselves to distinguish good from evil.
