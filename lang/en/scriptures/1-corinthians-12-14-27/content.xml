		<chapter number="12" number-en="12">
			<verse number="14" number-en="14">
				Now the body is not made up of one part but of many.
			</verse>
			<verse number="15" number-en="15">
				If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body.
			</verse>
			<verse number="16" number-en="16">
				And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body.
			</verse>
			<verse number="17" number-en="17">
				If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
			</verse>
			<verse number="18" number-en="18">
				But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.
			</verse>
			<verse number="19" number-en="19">
				If they were all one part, where would the body be?
			</verse>
			<verse number="20" number-en="20">
				As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
			</verse>
			<verse number="21" number-en="21">
				The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!"
			</verse>
			<verse number="22" number-en="22">
				On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
			</verse>
			<verse number="23" number-en="23">
				and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty,
			</verse>
			<verse number="24" number-en="24">
				while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it,
			</verse>
			<verse number="25" number-en="25">
				so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other.
			</verse>
			<verse number="26" number-en="26">
				If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
			</verse>
			<verse number="27" number-en="27">
				Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
			</verse>
