					Spiritual Gifts
				</p>
				Now about spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.
			</verse>
			<verse number="2" number-en="2">
				You know that when you were pagans, somehow or other you were influenced and led astray to mute idols.
			</verse>
			<verse number="3" number-en="3">
				Therefore I tell you that no one who is speaking by the Spirit of God says, "Jesus be cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit.
			</verse>
			<verse number="4" number-en="4">
				There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.
			</verse>
			<verse number="5" number-en="5">
				There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.
			</verse>
			<verse number="6" number-en="6">
				There are different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men.
			</verse>
			<verse number="7" number-en="7">
				Now to each one the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the common good.
			</verse>
			<verse number="8" number-en="8">
				To one there is given through the Spirit the message of wisdom, to another the message of knowledge by means of the same Spirit,
			</verse>
			<verse number="9" number-en="9">
				to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit,
			</verse>
			<verse number="10" number-en="10">
				to another miraculous powers, to another prophecy, to another distinguishing between spirits, to another speaking in different kinds of tongues, and to still another the interpretation of tongues.
			</verse>
			<verse number="11" number-en="11">
				All these are the work of one and the same Spirit, and he gives them to each one, just as he determines.
			</verse>

					One Body, Many Parts
				</p>
				The body is a unit, though it is made up of many parts; and though all its parts are many, they form one body. So it is with Christ.
			</verse>
			<verse number="13" number-en="13">
				For we were all baptized by one Spirit into one body — whether Jews or Greeks, slave or free — and we were all given the one Spirit to drink.
			</verse>
			<verse number="14" number-en="14">
				Now the body is not made up of one part but of many.
			</verse>
			<verse number="15" number-en="15">
				If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body.
			</verse>
			<verse number="16" number-en="16">
				And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," it would not for that reason cease to be part of the body.
			</verse>
			<verse number="17" number-en="17">
				If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be?
			</verse>
			<verse number="18" number-en="18">
				But in fact God has arranged the parts in the body, every one of them, just as he wanted them to be.
			</verse>
			<verse number="19" number-en="19">
				If they were all one part, where would the body be?
			</verse>
			<verse number="20" number-en="20">
				As it is, there are many parts, but one body.
			</verse>
			<verse number="21" number-en="21">
				The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you!" And the head cannot say to the feet, "I don't need you!"
			</verse>
			<verse number="22" number-en="22">
				On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
			</verse>
			<verse number="23" number-en="23">
				and the parts that we think are less honorable we treat with special honor. And the parts that are unpresentable are treated with special modesty,
			</verse>
			<verse number="24" number-en="24">
				while our presentable parts need no special treatment. But God has combined the members of the body and has given greater honor to the parts that lacked it,
			</verse>
			<verse number="25" number-en="25">
				so that there should be no division in the body, but that its parts should have equal concern for each other.
			</verse>
			<verse number="26" number-en="26">
				If one part suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.
			</verse>
			<verse number="27" number-en="27">
				Now you are the body of Christ, and each one of you is a part of it.
			</verse>
			<verse number="28" number-en="28">
				And in the church God has appointed first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, also those having gifts of healing, those able to help others, those with gifts of administration, and those speaking in different kinds of tongues.
			</verse>
			<verse number="29" number-en="29">
				Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
			</verse>
			<verse number="30" number-en="30">
				Do all have gifts of healing? Do all speak in tongues? Do all interpret?
			</verse>
			<verse number="31" number-en="31">
				Now eagerly desire the greater gifts.
				<p class="scripture-heading">
					Love
				</p>
				And now I will show you the most excellent way.
