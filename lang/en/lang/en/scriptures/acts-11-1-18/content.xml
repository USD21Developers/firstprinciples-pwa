					Peter Explains His Actions
				</p>
				The apostles and the brothers throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
			</verse>
			<verse number="2" number-en="2">
				So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcised believers criticized him
			</verse>
			<verse number="3" number-en="3">
				and said, "You went into the house of uncircumcised men and ate with them."
			</verse>
			<verse number="4" number-en="4">
				Peter began and explained everything to them precisely as it had happened:
			</verse>
			<verse number="5" number-en="5">
				"I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. I saw something like a large sheet being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to where I was.
			</verse>
			<verse number="6" number-en="6">
				I looked into it and saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild beasts, reptiles, and birds of the air.
			</verse>
			<verse number="7" number-en="7">
				Then I heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Peter. Kill and eat.'
			</verse>
			<verse number="8" number-en="8">
				I replied, 'Surely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
			</verse>
			<verse number="9" number-en="9">
				The voice spoke from heaven a second time, 'Do not call anything impure that God has made clean.'
			</verse>
			<verse number="10" number-en="10">
				This happened three times, and then it was all pulled up to heaven again.
			</verse>
			<verse number="11" number-en="11">
				Right then three men who had been sent to me from Caesarea stopped at the house where I was staying.
			</verse>
			<verse number="12" number-en="12">
				The Spirit told me to have no hesitation about going with them. These six brothers also went with me, and we entered the man's house.
			</verse>
			<verse number="13" number-en="13">
				He told us how he had seen an angel appear in his house and say, 'Send to Joppa for Simon who is called Peter.
			</verse>
			<verse number="14" number-en="14">
				He will bring you a message through which you and all your household will be saved.'
			</verse>
			<verse number="15" number-en="15">
				As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit came on them as he had come on us at the beginning.
			</verse>
			<verse number="16" number-en="16" jesuswords="true">
				Then I remembered what the Lord had said: '<span class="jesuswords">John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.</span>'
			</verse>
			<verse number="17" number-en="17">
				So if God gave them the same gift as he gave us, who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to think that I could oppose God?"
			</verse>
			<verse number="18" number-en="18">
				When they heard this, they had no further objections and praised God, saying, "So then, God has granted even the Gentiles repentance unto life."
