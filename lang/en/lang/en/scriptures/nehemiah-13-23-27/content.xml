		<chapter number="13" number-en="13">
			<verse number="23" number-en="23">
				Moreover, in those days I saw men of Judah who had married women from Ashdod, Ammon and Moab.
			</verse>
			<verse number="24" number-en="24">
				Half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod or the language of one of the other peoples, and did not know how to speak the language of Judah.
			</verse>
			<verse number="25" number-en="25">
				I rebuked them and called curses down on them. I beat some of the men and pulled out their hair. I made them take an oath in God's name and said: 'You are not to give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor are you to take their daughters in marriage for your sons or for yourselves.
			</verse>
			<verse number="26" number-en="26">
				Was it not because of marriages like these that Solomon king of Israel sinned? Among the many nations there was no king like him. He was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel, but even he was led into sin by foreign women.
			</verse>
			<verse number="27" number-en="27">
				Must we hear now that you too are doing all this terrible wickedness and are being unfaithful to our God by marrying foreign women?'
			</verse>
