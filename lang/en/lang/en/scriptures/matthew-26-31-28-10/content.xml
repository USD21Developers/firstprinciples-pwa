					Jesus Predicts Peter's Denial

				Then Jesus told them, "<span class="jesuswords">This very night you will all fall away on account of me, for it is written: <span class="scripturequote">'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'</span></span>

				<span class="jesuswords">But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.</span>"

			<verse number="34" number-en="34" jesuswords="true">
				"<span class="jesuswords">I tell you the truth,</span>" Jesus answered, "<span class="jesuswords">this very night, before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.</span>"

				But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the other disciples said the same.

					Gethsemane
				</p>
				Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to them, "<span class="jesuswords">Sit here while I go over there and pray.</span>"
			</verse>
			<verse number="37" number-en="37">
				He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee along with him, and he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
			</verse>
			<verse number="38" number-en="38" jesuswords="true">
				Then he said to them, "<span class="jesuswords">My soul is overwhelmed with sorrow to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me.</span>"
			</verse>
			<verse number="39" number-en="39" jesuswords="true">
				Going a little farther, he fell with his face to the ground and prayed, "<span class="jesuswords">My Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will.</span>"
			</verse>
			<verse number="40" number-en="40" jesuswords="true">
				Then he returned to his disciples and found them sleeping. "<span class="jesuswords">Could you men not keep watch with me for one hour?</span>" he asked Peter.
			</verse>
			<verse number="41" number-en="41" jesuswords="true">
				"<span class="jesuswords">Watch and pray so that you will not fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.</span>"
			</verse>
			<verse number="42" number-en="42" jesuswords="true">
				He went away a second time and prayed, "<span class="jesuswords">My Father, if it is not possible for this cup to be taken away unless I drink it, may your will be done.</span>"
			</verse>
			<verse number="43" number-en="43">
				When he came back, he again found them sleeping, because their eyes were heavy.
			</verse>
			<verse number="44" number-en="44">
				So he left them and went away once more and prayed the third time, saying the same thing.
			</verse>
			<verse number="45" number-en="45" jesuswords="true">
				Then he returned to the disciples and said to them, "<span class="jesuswords">Are you still sleeping and resting? Look, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span>

				<p class="scripture-heading">
					Jesus Arrested
				</p>
				While he was still speaking, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived. With him was a large crowd armed with swords and clubs, sent from the chief priests and the elders of the people.
			</verse>
			<verse number="48" number-en="48">
				Now the betrayer had arranged a signal with them: "The one I kiss is the man; arrest him."
			</verse>
			<verse number="49" number-en="49">
				Going at once to Jesus, Judas said, "Greetings, Rabbi!" and kissed him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="50" number-en="50" jesuswords="true">
				Jesus replied, "<span class="jesuswords">Friend, do what you came for.</span>" Then the men stepped forward, seized Jesus and arrested him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="51" number-en="51">
				With that, one of Jesus' companions reached for his sword, drew it out and struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his ear.
			</verse>
			<verse number="52" number-en="52" jesuswords="true">
				"<span class="jesuswords">Put your sword back in its place,</span>" Jesus said to him, "<span class="jesuswords">for all who draw the sword will die by the sword.</span>

			<verse number="53" number-en="53" jesuswords="true">
				<span class="jesuswords">Do you think I cannot call on my Father, and he will at once put at my disposal more than twelve legions of angels?</span>

			<verse number="54" number-en="54" jesuswords="true">
				<span class="jesuswords">But how then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must happen in this way?</span>"
			</verse>
			<verse number="55" number-en="55" jesuswords="true">
				At that time Jesus said to the crowd, "<span class="jesuswords">Am I leading a rebellion, that you have come out with swords and clubs to capture me? Every day I sat in the temple courts teaching, and you did not arrest me.</span>
			</verse>
			<verse number="56" number-en="56" jesuswords="true">
				<span class="jesuswords">But this has all taken place that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.</span>" Then all the disciples deserted him and fled.
			</verse>
			<verse number="57" number-en="57">
				<p class="scripture-heading">
					Before the Sanhedrin
				</p>
				Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of the law and the elders had assembled.
			</verse>
			<verse number="58" number-en="58">
				But Peter followed him at a distance, right up to the courtyard of the high priest. He entered and sat down with the guards to see the outcome.
			</verse>
			<verse number="59" number-en="59">
				The chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false evidence against Jesus so that they could put him to death.
			</verse>
			<verse number="60" number-en="60">
				But they did not find any, though many false witnesses came forward. Finally two came forward
			</verse>
			<verse number="61" number-en="61">
				and declared, "This fellow said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
			</verse>
			<verse number="62" number-en="62">
				Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Are you not going to answer? What is this testimony that these men are bringing against you?"
			</verse>
			<verse number="63" number-en="63">
				But Jesus remained silent. The high priest said to him, "I charge you under oath by the living God: Tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."
			</verse>
			<verse number="64" number-en="64" jesuswords="true">
				"<span class="jesuswords">Yes, it is as you say,</span>" Jesus replied. "<span class="jesuswords">But I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.</span>"
			</verse>
			<verse number="65" number-en="65">
				Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "He has spoken blasphemy! Why do we need any more witnesses? Look, now you have heard the blasphemy.
			</verse>
			<verse number="66" number-en="66">
				What do you think?" "He is worthy of death," they answered.
			</verse>
			<verse number="67" number-en="67">
				Then they spit in his face and struck him with their fists. Others slapped him
			</verse>
			<verse number="68" number-en="68">

			<verse number="69" number-en="69">
				<p class="scripture-heading">
					Peter Disowns Jesus
				</p>
				Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. "You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said.
			</verse>
			<verse number="70" number-en="70">
				But he denied it before them all. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
			</verse>
			<verse number="71" number-en="71">
				Then he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people there, "This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth."
			</verse>
			<verse number="72" number-en="72">
				He denied it again, with an oath: "I don't know the man!"
			</verse>
			<verse number="73" number-en="73">
				After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away."
			</verse>
			<verse number="74" number-en="74">
				Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, "I don't know the man!" Immediately a rooster crowed.
			</verse>
			<verse number="75" number-en="75" jesuswords="true">
				Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "<span class="jesuswords">Before the rooster crows, you will disown me three times.</span>" And he went outside and wept bitterly.

				<p class="scripture-heading">
					Judas Hangs Himself
				</p>
				Early in the morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people came to the decision to put Jesus to death.
			</verse>
			<verse number="2" number-en="2">
				They bound him, led him away and handed him over to Pilate, the governor.
			</verse>
			<verse number="3" number-en="3">
				When Judas, who had betrayed him, saw that Jesus was condemned, he was seized with remorse and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders.
			</verse>
			<verse number="4" number-en="4">
				"I have sinned," he said, "for I have betrayed innocent blood." "What is that to us?" they replied. "That's your responsibility."
			</verse>
			<verse number="5" number-en="5">
				So Judas threw the money into the temple and left. Then he went away and hanged himself.
			</verse>
			<verse number="6" number-en="6">
				The chief priests picked up the coins and said, "It is against the law to put this into the treasury, since it is blood money."
			</verse>
			<verse number="7" number-en="7">
				So they decided to use the money to buy the potter's field as a burial place for foreigners.
			</verse>
			<verse number="8" number-en="8">
				That is why it has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
			</verse>
			<verse number="9" number-en="9">
				Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled: "They took the thirty silver coins, the price set on him by the people of Israel,
			</verse>
			<verse number="10" number-en="10">
				and they used them to buy the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."
			</verse>
			<verse number="11" number-en="11" jesuswords="true">
				<p class="scripture-heading">
					Jesus Before Pilate
				</p>
				Meanwhile Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "<span class="jesuswords">Yes, it is as you say,</span>" Jesus replied.
			</verse>
			<verse number="12" number-en="12">
				When he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he gave no answer.
			</verse>
			<verse number="13" number-en="13">
				Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear the testimony they are bringing against you?"
			</verse>
			<verse number="14" number-en="14">
				But Jesus made no reply, not even to a single charge — to the great amazement of the governor.
			</verse>
			<verse number="15" number-en="15">
				Now it was the governor's custom at the Feast to release a prisoner chosen by the crowd.
			</verse>
			<verse number="16" number-en="16">
				At that time they had a notorious prisoner, called Barabbas.
			</verse>
			<verse number="17" number-en="17">
				So when the crowd had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"
			</verse>
			<verse number="18" number-en="18">
				For he knew it was out of envy that they had handed Jesus over to him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="19" number-en="19">
				While Pilate was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him this message: "Don't have anything to do with that innocent man, for I have suffered a great deal today in a dream because of him."
			</verse>
			<verse number="20" number-en="20">
				But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and to have Jesus executed.
			</verse>
			<verse number="21" number-en="21">
				"Which of the two do you want me to release to you?" asked the governor. "Barabbas," they answered.
			</verse>
			<verse number="22" number-en="22">
				"What shall I do, then, with Jesus who is called Christ?" Pilate asked. They all answered, "Crucify him!"
			</verse>
			<verse number="23" number-en="23">
				"Why? What crime has he committed?" asked Pilate. But they shouted all the louder, "Crucify him!"
			</verse>
			<verse number="24" number-en="24">
				When Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that instead an uproar was starting, he took water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. "I am innocent of this man's blood," he said. "It is your responsibility!"
			</verse>
			<verse number="25" number-en="25">
				All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and on our children!"
			</verse>
			<verse number="26" number-en="26">
				Then he released Barabbas to them. But he had Jesus flogged, and handed him over to be crucified.
			</verse>
			<verse number="27" number-en="27">
				<p class="scripture-heading">
					The Soldiers Mock Jesus
				</p>
				Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the Praetorium and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="28" number-en="28">
				They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,
			</verse>
			<verse number="29" number-en="29">
				and then twisted together a crown of thorns and set it on his head. They put a staff in his right hand and knelt in front of him and mocked him. "Hail, king of the Jews!" they said.
			</verse>
			<verse number="30" number-en="30">
				They spit on him, and took the staff and struck him on the head again and again.
			</verse>
			<verse number="31" number-en="31">
				After they had mocked him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="32" number-en="32">
				<p class="scripture-heading">
					The Crucifixion
				</p>
				As they were going out, they met a man from Cyrene, named Simon, and they forced him to carry the cross.
			</verse>
			<verse number="33" number-en="33">
				They came to a place called Golgotha (which means The Place of the Skull).
			</verse>
			<verse number="34" number-en="34">
				There they offered Jesus wine to drink, mixed with gall; but after tasting it, he refused to drink it.
			</verse>
			<verse number="35" number-en="35">
				When they had crucified him, they divided up his clothes by casting lots.
			</verse>
			<verse number="36" number-en="36">
				And sitting down, they kept watch over him there.
			</verse>
			<verse number="37" number-en="37">
				Above his head they placed the written charge against him: THIS IS JESUS, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
			</verse>
			<verse number="38" number-en="38">
				Two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.
			</verse>
			<verse number="39" number-en="39">
				Those who passed by hurled insults at him, shaking their heads
			</verse>
			<verse number="40" number-en="40">
				and saying, "You who are going to destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! Come down from the cross, if you are the Son of God!"
			</verse>
			<verse number="41" number-en="41">
				In the same way the chief priests, the teachers of the law and the elders mocked him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="42" number-en="42">
				"He saved others," they said, "but he can't save himself! He's the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="43" number-en="43">
				He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he wants him, for he said, 'I am the Son of God.'"
			</verse>
			<verse number="44" number-en="44">
				In the same way the robbers who were crucified with him also heaped insults on him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="45" number-en="45">
				<p class="scripture-heading">
					The Death of Jesus
				</p>
				From the sixth hour until the ninth hour darkness came over all the land.
			</verse>
			<verse number="46" number-en="46" jesuswords="true">
				About the ninth hour Jesus cried out in a loud voice, "<span class="jesuswords">Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</span>" — which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
			</verse>
			<verse number="47" number-en="47">
				When some of those standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling Elijah."
			</verse>
			<verse number="48" number-en="48">
				Immediately one of them ran and got a sponge. He filled it with wine vinegar, put it on a stick, and offered it to Jesus to drink.
			</verse>
			<verse number="49" number-en="49">
				The rest said, "Now leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah comes to save him."
			</verse>
			<verse number="50" number-en="50">
				And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit.
			</verse>
			<verse number="51" number-en="51">
				At that moment the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. The earth shook and the rocks split.
			</verse>
			<verse number="52" number-en="52">
				The tombs broke open and the bodies of many holy people who had died were raised to life.
			</verse>
			<verse number="53" number-en="53">
				They came out of the tombs, and after Jesus' resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many people.
			</verse>
			<verse number="54" number-en="54">
				When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and all that had happened, they were terrified, and exclaimed, "Surely he was the Son of God!"
			</verse>
			<verse number="55" number-en="55">
				Many women were there, watching from a distance. They had followed Jesus from Galilee to care for his needs.
			</verse>
			<verse number="56" number-en="56">
				Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.
			</verse>
			<verse number="57" number-en="57">
				<p class="scripture-heading">
					The Burial of Jesus
				</p>
				As evening approached, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who had himself become a disciple of Jesus.
			</verse>
			<verse number="58" number-en="58">
				Going to Pilate, he asked for Jesus' body, and Pilate ordered that it be given to him.
			</verse>
			<verse number="59" number-en="59">
				Joseph took the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
			</verse>
			<verse number="60" number-en="60">
				and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut out of the rock. He rolled a big stone in front of the entrance to the tomb and went away.
			</verse>
			<verse number="61" number-en="61">
				Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting there opposite the tomb.
			</verse>
			<verse number="62" number-en="62">
				<p class="scripture-heading">
					The Guard at the Tomb
				</p>
				The next day, the one after Preparation Day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went to Pilate.
			</verse>
			<verse number="63" number-en="63">
				"Sir," they said, "we remember that while he was still alive that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise again.'
			</verse>
			<verse number="64" number-en="64">
				So give the order for the tomb to be made secure until the third day. Otherwise, his disciples may come and steal the body and tell the people that he has been raised from the dead. This last deception will be worse than the first."
			</verse>
			<verse number="65" number-en="65">
				"Take a guard," Pilate answered. "Go, make the tomb as secure as you know how."
			</verse>
			<verse number="66" number-en="66">
				So they went and made the tomb secure by putting a seal on the stone and posting the guard.

					The Resurrection
				</p>
				After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb.
			</verse>
			<verse number="2" number-en="2">
				There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it.
			</verse>
			<verse number="3" number-en="3">
				His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.

			<verse number="4" number-en="4">
				The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men.

			<verse number="5" number-en="5">
				The angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
