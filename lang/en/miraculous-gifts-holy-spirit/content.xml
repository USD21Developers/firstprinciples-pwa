			Acts 8:1-25: Context is after Stephen’s martyrdom. Great persecution breaks out. Most leave, but the Apostles stay in Jerusalem. Philip, one of The Seven who had received the gifts in Acts 6:1-8, goes to Samaria. He performs many miraculous signs and healings to get people to believe (v. 12), including Simon the Sorcerer (v. 13) and they are baptized. (They became Christians and thus receive the forgiveness of sins and the gift (indwelling) of the Holy Spirit as promised in Acts 2:38.) When the Apostles come to Samaria, Simon saw the Spirit’s gifts were only given by Apostles’ laying on of hands and offers them money for the ability (Acts 8:18). Note: Simon did not ask Philip for the gifts, because he never saw Philip pass them on. In fact, he could not. Simon is rebuked for having the wrong motivation.

			Acts 19:1-6: Paul finds disciples in Ephesus who did not know what the Holy Spirit was because they had only received John’s baptism. Then they were baptized into the name of Jesus Christ to receive the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (v.5).  Then they receive the miraculous gifts of prophecy and speaking in tongues by the laying on of Paul’s hands (v.6). Paul is an Apostle.

			Apostles were able to pass on the gifts because they were Apostles. The Apostles possessed the ability to perform miracles even during the ministry of Christ (Luke 9:1).  The ability to perform the gifts were not given at Pentecost.

			1 Corinthians 12 and 14 are not the “directives” on how to receive tongues (the church there had already received them), but rather the “correctives” on how to use them because everyone was speaking at the same time and misusing this amazing gift.  1 Corinthians 12:28-30 shows that tongues as a gift were not given to everyone in the church.  Thus, the concept of a “Pentecostal church” (every member speaking in tongues) is against Scripture.

			1 Corinthians 13:8-10: “Perfection” here could not mean the coming of Christ because it is in the neuter gender in Greek, not the masculine gender.  When perfection comes probably refers to the canonization of the Bible sometime after the first century.  At that time, all the miraculous gifts would be gone because all the Apostles and those to whom they passed the gifts would have died.

			The two purposes of the miraculous gifts from 1 Corinthians 14:20-22 was: 1) To get non-believers to believe, and 2) To edify the Christians and strengthen their faith. Note: Tongues were ONLY to be used to bring non-believers to faith

			Speaking in “tongues” is common in many religions (Mormon, Catholic, Islam, etc.) because religion often becomes dried and staid. These are also called “ecstatic utterances” – non-understandable sounds and fragments of speech.
