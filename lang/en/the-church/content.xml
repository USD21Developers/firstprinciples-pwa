			Through the centuries the church was corrupted by traditions of men — false doctrines, such as: infant baptism, original sin, perpetual virginity of Mary, priests as clergy, papal infallibility, etc… This becomes the Catholic Church. In 364 AD the Roman Empire is split into two parts. This division leads to a split in Christianity — the eastern portion becomes the Eastern Orthodox Church and the western part becomes the Roman Catholic Church. Practices diverge, for example — Orthodox has married priests, Roman Catholic priests are celibate. The "Great Schism" occurs in 1054 AD, as the leaders of "each church" excommunicate each other.

			1500's Reformation Movement — Martin Luther (Lutheran Church) He takes a stand against the Roman Catholic Church on these convictions: Bible authority over church authority, salvation by faith not works, and the priesthood of all believers, yet still baptizes infants. Other noted reformers were John Calvin (Presbyterian Church), Ulrich Zwingli and Conrad Grebel (Anabaptists). Anabaptists were heavily persecuted by Catholics and some reformers, because of their stand for adult baptism. Henry VIII (Anglican Church / Church of England) He breaks from the Catholic Church over his right to divorce his wife. He appoints himself head of the church. Later in the United States, the Anglican Church becomes the Episcopalian Church, since members will not follow the king of England.

			1800's Restoration Movement — Alexander Campbell and Barton Stone (Mainline Church of Christ and Conservative Christian Church) Take a stand against both Catholic and Protestant doctrines of salvation. They preach to be saved one must have personal faith in Christ, repentance and baptism (immersion) for the forgiveness of sin to receive the Holy Spirit. In reaction to Catholicism, their congregations are autonomous — self-governing. (1906 is the formal split between Mainline Church of Christ, which is non-instrumental, and the Conservative Christian Church, which is instrumental.) Joseph Smith (Mormon Church) divides from Restoration Movement in 1830 over "new revelation" — the Book of Mormon.

			1979 Boston Movement (International Church of Christ) — Kip McKean — Baptized at the University of Florida in 1972, divides from Mainline Churches of Christ and Crossroads Movement over: Bible Church not just New Testament Church, only disciples are true Christians, each and every member of church must be a disciple, each member should be in discipling relationships, vision to evangelize the nations in a generation, the planting of new churches to achieve this vision, central leadership not autonomous congregations, and the role of women. In 2002, the International Churches of Christ return to a more Mainline Church of Christ theology — each congregation becomes autonomous (self-governing), calling a central leadership and the vision to evangelize the nations in a generation "unbiblical." Around the world, thousands fall away.

			A local congregation is called the "visible church." In the first century, all the "visible churches" made up the "church universal." However, since so many "visible churches" have departed from true doctrine and because all sold-out baptized disciples are not in one fellowship, we should strive to be a member of a local congregation.

			The Greek word for church is "ekklesia" which means "assembly" or "called out" ("Ek" meaning "out" and "kaleo" meaning "to call"). To be a disciple is to be "called out" from the world. Therefore, the church in the Bible was the "assembly" of the "called out."

			"Be silent where the Bible speaks, and speak where the Bible is silent." In applying Scriptural principles to build the visible church, we believe we must obey God's Word, but where the Bible does not prohibit a practice or name, we are free to use our God-given creativity. Genesis 2:19 (Examples: The principles for "Bible Talks," "Lead Evangelist," "Discipleship Partners" and "Regions" are in the Scriptures, though these terms are not. However, nowhere are they prohibited. Also instrumental music and paid Women's Ministry Leaders are not prohibited in the Scriptures.)
