			Through the centuries the church was corrupted by traditions of men – false doctrines, such as: infant baptism, original sin, perpetual virginity of Mary, priests as clergy, papal infallibility, etc.  This becomes the Catholic Church.  In 364 AD the Roman Empire is split into two parts.  This division leads to a split in Christianity – the eastern portion becomes the Eastern Orthodox Church and the western section becomes the Roman Catholic Church.  Practices diverge.  For example: The Orthodox Church has married priests, while Roman Catholic priests are celibate. The “Great Schism” occurs in 1054 AD, as the leaders of “each church” excommunicate each other.

			1500’s Reformation Movement – Martin Luther (Lutheran Church) takes a stand against the Roman Catholic Church on these convictions: Bible authority over church authority, salvation by faith not works, and the priesthood of all believers, yet still baptizes infants. Other noted reformers were John Calvin (Presbyterian Church), and Ulrich Zwingli (Reformed Church), as well as Conrad Grebel (Anabaptists). The Anabaptists were heavily persecuted by Catholics and by some reformers, because of their stand for adult baptism.  Henry VIII (Anglican Church / Church of England) broke from the Catholic Church over his right to divorce his wife. He appoints himself head of the church. Later in the United States, the Anglican Church becomes the Episcopalian Church since members will not follow the king of England.

			1800’s Restoration Movement – Alexander Campbell and Barton Stone (Mainline Church of Christ and Conservative Christian Church) Take a stand against both Catholic and Protestant doctrines of salvation. They preached that to be saved one must have personal faith in Christ, repentance and baptism (immersion) for the forgiveness of sin to receive the Holy Spirit. In reaction to Catholicism, their congregations are autonomous – self-governing. (In 1906 was the formal split between Mainline Church of Christ, which is non-instrumental, and the Conservative Christian Church, which is instrumental.) Joseph Smith (Mormon Church) divides from Restoration Movement in 1830 over his “new revelation” – the Book of Mormon.

			1979 Boston Movement (International Church of Christ) was formed by Kip McKean. He was baptized at the University of Florida in 1972. In time, the Boston Movement divided from not only the Mainline Churches of Christ, but also the Crossroads Movement over the Bible’s Five Core Convictions: 1) Bible Church not just New Testament Church (2 Timothy 3:16-17); 2) Speak where the Bible is silent and be silent where the Bible speaks; in other words, we are “free” to practice and name anything as long as it does not conflict with Scripture (Genesis 2:19); 3) Only baptized disciples are true Christians, members of God’s church, and should be in discipling relationships (Matthew 28:19-20). 4) God’s plan is for a central leadership of His people, as autonomy for a local congregation is sin (Numbers 27:12-18). 5) God’s will is for the evangelization of the nations in this generation (1 Timothy 2:3-4). In 2002, the International Churches of Christ returned to Mainline Church of Christ theology. Of note: Each congregation became autonomous (self-governing), discipling called “optional,” central leadership was labeled “unbiblical,” and the vision for the evangelization of the nations in this generation “impossible.” Around the world, thousands fall-away.

			2006 SoldOut Movement (Portland Movement / International Christian Church) officially begins in Portland, Oregon based on the Bible’s Five Core Convictions preached again by Kip McKean. It began as a revival movement within what was left of the International Churches of Christ. The International Churches of Christ separated from the International Christian Churches, because of the SoldOut Movement’s stand on the Bible’s Five Core Convictions.

			A local congregation is called the “visible church.” In the first century, all the “visible churches” made up the “church universal.” However, since so many “visible churches” have departed from true doctrine and because all sold-out baptized disciples are not in one fellowship, we should strive to be a member of a local congregation where everyone is sold-out and under central leadership.

			The Greek word for church is “ekklesia” which means “assembly” or “called out.”  (“Ek” meaning “out” and “kaleo” meaning “to call.”)  To be a disciple is to be “called out” from the world. Therefore, the church in the Bible was the “assembly” of the “called out.”
