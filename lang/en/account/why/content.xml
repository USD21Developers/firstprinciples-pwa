			Since its creation in 2012, the First Principles and Follow Up Studies App has become a valuable asset for teaching the core principles of the faith. Whenever God's commands are accurately taught and obeyed, hearts are healed and the light of the truth shines brighter. This app is intended to thoroughly equip every disciple of Jesus Christ in that mission. As of January 31, 2021, there will be a small annual charge of $9.99 USD for the privilege of using this powerful tool.

			It may already be obvious to you how valuable this app can be: The Scriptures are instantly accessible and the audio instruction readily available. Its usefulness as a tool in making disciples has been well demonstrated. What if you could extend its use into communities that are even beyond your reach? What if your financial support could ensure that the app is making a difference in a developing country, even while you yourself are resting?

			In the above Scripture, God commands the Israelites to seek the good of the cities where they will live in exile. As well, He also expects the same from modern-day Christians, who are likewise called "exiles" in the New Testament (Hebrews 11:13, 1 Peter 2:11). Thus God commands that His people seek the good of their secular community. Indeed, this ultimately benefits all of us. Also, paying for the use of the app will inspire non-Christians to praise God:

			"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead, they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."
