			Since its creation in 2012, the First Principles app has become a valuable asset for teaching the core principles of the faith.  Whenever God's commands are accurately taught and obeyed, hearts are healed and the light of truth shines brighter.  This app is intended to thoroughly equip every disciple of Jesus Christ in that mission.

			It may already be obvious how useful this app can be: the scriptures instantly accessible, the audio instruction readily available.  Its use as a tool in disciple-making has been apparent for years.  What if you could extend its use into communities that are even beyond your reach?  What if your financial support could ensure that the app is making a difference, even while you yourself are resting?
