			Since its creation in 2012, the First Principles app has become a valuable asset for teaching the core principles of the faith.  Whenever God's commands are accurately taught and obeyed, hearts are healed and the light of truth shines brighter.  This app is intended to thoroughly equip every disciple of Jesus Christ in that mission.

			It may already be obvious how helpful this app can be: the scriptures instantly accessible, the audio instruction readily available.  Its usefulness as a tool in making disciples has been shown.  What if you could extend its use into communities that are even beyond your reach?  What if your financial support could ensure that the app is making a difference, even while you yourself are resting?

			"You are the light of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before men, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven."
