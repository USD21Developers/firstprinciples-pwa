				Please revise your password.  For your protection, we require that it must have a minimum level of unpredictability in order to prevent potential hackers from guessing it.

			<p>
				A minimum length of 8 characters is required.  Using a phrase (rather than a single word) is encouraged, because phrases are less predictable.
